## About the Fellowship

The Buildables Data Science Fellowship is a 12-week intensive training program designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and industry application. The curriculum rigorously progresses through three phases:
*   **Foundations:** Data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
*   **Machine Learning:** Supervised/Unsupervised learning, model optimization, and pipelines.
*   **Deployment & Deep Learning:** Neural networks, NLP, and deploying models via APIs.
