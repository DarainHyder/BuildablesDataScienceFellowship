## `sudo init_data_scientist.sh`

Welcome to my **Buildables Data Science Fellowship** repository. This isn't just a collection of folders; it's the logfile of a 12-week transformation from code enthusiast to Data Scientist.

Here, you'll find everything from raw EDA on messy datasets to deploying state-of-the-art Deep Learning models. 

```python
while fellowship_active:
    learn()
    build()
    deploy()
```

## ⚡ Featured Projects

### 🛡️ Cyberbullying Detection System
> *Protecting digital spaces with NLP.*

**📍 Location:** [`Week_10-12/CyberBullying-DetectionSystem`](Week_10-12/CyberBullying-DetectionSystem)

*   **The Problem:** Social media can be toxic. Manual moderation doesn't scale.
*   **The Code:** A robust NLP pipeline using **LSTMs** and **BERT** embeddings to classify toxic comments with high accuracy. Wrapped in a **Flask API**.
*   **The Impact:** Real-time flagging of offensive content, making the internet a safer place.

### 🌌 NASA Space Apps Challenge
> *Hacking the cosmos with data.*

**📍 Location:** [`Week_7/NASA-Space-App`](Week_7/NASA-Space-App)

*   **The Event:** 48 hours. Global competition. Real NASA data.
*   **The Build:** Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize space debris and predict potential collisions.
*   **The Vibe:** High pressure, caffeine-fueled collaboration, and rapid prototyping.

### 🎬 "What Should I Watch?" Recommender
> *Because scrolling Netflix takes too long.*

**📍 Location:** [`Week_3/Mini-Project`](Week_3/Mini-Project)

*   **The Tech:** Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering.
*   **The Result:** A personalized engine that knows your taste better than you do.
