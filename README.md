## About the Fellowship

The Buildables Data Science Fellowship is a 12-week intensive training program designing to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and industry application. The curriculum rigorously progresses through three phases:
1.  **Foundations:** Data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
2.  **Machine Learning:** Supervised/Unsupervised learning, model optimization, and pipelines.
3.  **Deployment & Deep Learning:** Neural networks, NLP, and deploying models via APIs.
