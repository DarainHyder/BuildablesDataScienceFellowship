## 📂 Main Projects

This section highlights the three major milestones of my fellowship.

### 1. 🛡️ Final Project: Cyberbullying Detection System
*   **Type:** End-to-End NLP Multiclass Classification System
*   **Link:** [View Project](https://github.com/DarainHyder/BuildablesDataScienceFellowship/tree/main/Week_10-12/CyberBullying-DetectionSystem)

**Overview**
A robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to identify and classify toxic online behavior. The system moves beyond binary classification to detect specific types of cyberbullying (Age, Ethnicity, Religion, Gender, Other).

**Key Features**
*   **Model:** Logistic Regression with Class Balancing.
*   **Pipeline:** Custom preprocessing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, TF-IDF).
*   **Deployment:** REST API via **FastAPI** and an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard.

### 2. 🌌 Hackathon Project: ExoVision-AI (NASA Space Apps)
*   **Type:** 48-Hour Global Hackathon Submission
*   **Link:** [View Project](https://github.com/DarainHyder/BuildablesDataScienceFellowship/tree/main/Week_7/NASA-Space-App)

**Overview**
Developed during the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, ExoVision-AI is an automated system for classifying celestial objects as "Confirmed Exoplanets" or "Candidates" using NASA's K2 Planets and Candidates Catalog.

**Key Features**
*   **Algorithm:** Ensemble of **XGBoost** (99% Accuracy) and **Decision Trees**.
*   **Interface:** Full-stack **Flask** application with real-time visualization dashboards.

### 3. 📊 Mini Project: Fellowship Feedback Analysis
*   **Type:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
*   **Link:** [View Project](https://github.com/DarainHyder/BuildablesDataScienceFellowship/tree/main/Week_3/Mini-Project)

**Overview**
A data-driven analysis of feedback gathered from fellowship participants to identify key trends in curriculum effectiveness and student satisfaction.

**Key Features**
*   **Tech Stack:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
*   **Outcome:** Actionable insights presented through comprehensive visualization reports.
